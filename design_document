This file is written in textile, as to be better suited for online documentation later, when it is converted to HTML.

h1. Autofocus

h2. Intent

I intend to create a computerized version of the Autofocus system, one that is portable, simple, and human-executable, if need arises.

h2. Format

I will have to implement a sensible, no-nonsense format for the files to have. I would prefer the file to be human editable, and easy to parse, so that when/if the time comes to switch systems to something new, it won't be a hassle.
